# 3D-Solid-Modelling-and-Assembly-of-a-Single-Cylinder-IC-Engine

This project features a detailed 3D CAD model designed to understand the structural components and functionality of an IC engine.

This project provides a solid CAD model of a single-cylinder internal combustion engine. The design illustrates key components and their interactions, offering insights into the internal mechanism of an IC engine.
The model is ideal for understanding IC engine design and simulation purposes.
